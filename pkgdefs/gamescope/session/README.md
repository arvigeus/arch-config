## Upscaling

The `-F fsr` and `-F nis` flags can be used to upscale games using AMD FidelityFXâ„¢ Super Resolution 1.0 (FSR) or NVIDIA Image Scaling v1.0.3 (NIS) respectively. You can also use `-S integer` for integer upscaling or `-S stretch` for stretch scaling.

To upscale a 720p game to 1440p using FSR:

```sh
gamescope -h 720 -H 1440 -F fsr -- supertuxkart
```

To run a game at 1080p internal resolution but display it at 4K using NIS:

```sh
gamescope -w 1920 -h 1080 -W 3840 -H 2160 -F nis -- supertuxkart
```

Games with low resolutions typically use linear filtering on fullscreen by default and sometimes get stretched. This is specially noticeable in classic JRPG. To have a pixelated look and keep aspect ratio:

```sh
gamescope -F nearest -S fit -- tecnoballz
```

Filters can be changed while the game is running:

- `Super+n` toggle nearest filtering.
- `Super+u` toggle FSR upscaling.
- `Super+y` toggle NIS upscaling.
- `Super+o` increase FSR sharpness by 1.
- `Super+i` decrease FSR sharpness by 1.

## Notes

- Trying to start gamescope with `gamescope --prefer-vk-device 1002:73ef` doesn't work. Use `switcherooctl launch gamescope` instead.
- If session fails to start, uncomment the `exec > /tmp/gamescope-session.log 2>&1` line.
- Starting steam with `steam -steamos -gamepadui`
- Run `/usr/bin/gamescope-session` from time to time to check for errors.

## Troubleshooting

### Setup stops at selecting network

1. Install `gamescope-session-steam-git` (`sudo pacman -S --needed --noconfirm gamescope-session-steam-git`)
2. Create `~/.config/environment.d/gamescope-session-plus.conf`:

   ```conf
   CLIENTCMD="steam-native -gamepadui -steamos3 -steampal -steamdeck -pipewire-dmabuf"
   GAMESCOPECMD="switcherooctl launch gamescope -e -f"
   ```

3. Logout and select `Steam Big Pictur (Wayland)` session
4. Finish setup
5. At this point gamescope session starts, but it hangs when trying to start any game
6. Uninstall `gamescope-session-steam-git`

### Games start on wrong resolution

Go to the game page, select settings, and set specific resolution

### Decky Loader is not enabled
